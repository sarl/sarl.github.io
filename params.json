{"name":"SARL","tagline":"Agent-oriented programming language","body":"# SARL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSARL is a general-purpose agent-oriented language.\r\n\r\nSARL aims at providing the fundamental abstractions for dealing with concurrency, distribution, interaction, decentralization, reactivity, autonomy and dynamic reconfiguration. \r\nThese high-level features are now considered as the major requirements for an easy and practical implementation of modern complex software applications. \r\nWe are convinced that the agent-oriented paradigm holds the keys to effectively meet this challenge.\r\n\r\nConsidering the variety of existing approaches and meta-models in the field of agent-oriented engineering and more generally multi-agent systems, our approach remains as generic as possible and highly extensible to easily integrate new concepts and features. The language is platform- and architecture-independent. \r\n\r\nHowever, we provide a first set of tools to support its execution based on the new version 2.0 of the Janus (see http://www.janusproject.io) platform, but it can be linked with other existing agent platforms and frameworks. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Contributors\r\n\r\nSebastian RODRIGUEZ, Nicolas GAUD, Stéphane GALLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2014 Sebastian RODRIGUEZ, Nicolas GAUD, Stéphane GALLAND.\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
