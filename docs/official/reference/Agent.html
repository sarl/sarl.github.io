    <meta name="description" content="SARL is a general-purpose agent-oriented language.
SARL aims at providing the fundamental abstractions for dealing with concurrency, distribution, interaction, decentralization, reactivity, autonomy and dynamic reconfiguration. These high-level features are now considered as the major requirements for an easy and practical implementation of modern complex software applications. We are convinced that the agent-oriented paradigm holds the keys to effectively meet this challenge.
Considering the variety of existing approaches and meta-models in the field of agent-oriented engineering and more generally multi-agent systems, our approach remains as generic as possible and highly extensible to easily integrate new concepts and features. The language is platform- and architecture-independent.

<p>This document describes the features related to the definition of an agent in SARL.
Before reading this document, we recommend that you read
the <a href="./GeneralSyntax.html">General Syntax Reference</a>,
the <a href="./Skill.html">Skill Reference</a>, and the
<a href="./BIC.html">Built-in Capacity Reference</a>.</p>

<p><strong>An agent is an autonomous entity having a set of skills to realize the capacities it exhibits</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="1-where-is-living-an-agent">1. Where is living an agent?</h2>

<p>Before detailing the architecture and the definition tools of an agent, it may be helpful to understand
where is “living” an agent in the multi-agent system.</p>

<p>The following figure illustrates the position of an agent (at the center of the figure) in different contexts.
The details are discussed below.</p>

<p><img src="./contexts.png" alt="Contexts" /></p>

<h3 id="11-default-context">1.1. Default Context</h3>

<p>When it is spawn, an agent is living inside the system in a place named “<em>Context</em>”.</p>

<p><strong>A Context defines the boundary of a sub-system, and gathers a collection of spaces</strong>.
A Space is the support of the interaction between agents respecting the rules defined in the spaces’ specification.</p>

<p><span class="label label-warning">Important Note</span> In each context, there is at least one particular space called <em>Default Space</em> to which all agents in this context belong.</p>

<p>It ensures the existence of a common shared space to all agents in the same context. Each agent can then create
specific public or private spaces to achieve its personal goals (the blue space on the figure above).</p>

<p><span class="label label-warning">Important Note</span> Since their creation, agents are incorporated into a context called the <strong>Default Context</strong>. It is important to notice that the <em>Default Context</em> is not necessarily the same for every agent.</p>

<p>An agent has an identifier for each space it is involved in. For the case of event-based interaction
spaces, this identifier is  called “address”.</p>

<h3 id="12-external-contexts">1.2. External Contexts</h3>

<p>During its lifetime, an agent may join and participate in other contexts that are not the default context.
They are called the external contexts of the agent.</p>

<p><span class="label label-info">Note</span> There is no restriction about the number of contexts in which an agent is belonging to, except that it is always in its default context.</p>

<p>For joining or leaving a context, the agent must use the <code>ExternalContextAccess</code> built-in capacity. It is detailed in the
<a href="./BIC.html">Built-in Capacity Reference</a>.</p>

<h3 id="13-from-flat-to-hierarchical-system-with-the-inner-context">1.3. From Flat to Hierarchical System with the Inner Context</h3>

<p>In 1967, Arthur Koestler coined the term <em>holon</em> as an attempt to
conciliate holistic and reductionist visions of the world.
A holon represents a part-whole construct that can be seen as a
component of a higher level system or as whole composed of other
self-similar holons as substructures.</p>

<p>Holonic Systems grew from the need to find comprehensive construct
that could help explain social phenomena. Since then, it came to be
used in a wide range of domains, including Philosophy,
Manufacturing Systems, and Multi-Agents Systems.</p>

<p>Several works have studied this question and they have proposed a number
of models inspired from their experience in different domains.
In many cases, we find the idea of <em>agents composed of other agents</em>.</p>

<p>More recently, the importance of holonic multi-agent systems has been
recognized by different methodologies such as <a href="http://www.aspecs.org">ASPECS</a> or O-MASE.</p>

<p><span class="label label-info">Note</span> In SARL, we recognize that agents can be composed of other agents. Therefore, SARL agents are in fact holons that can compose each other to define hierarchical or recursive multi-agent system, called holarchies.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this, SARL agents are self-similar structures that 
compose each other via their contexts. Each agent defines its own context, called <strong>Inner Context</strong>.
Because this inner context may be joined by other agents, or agents may
be spawn inside this inner context, it is possible to build a holarchy.</p>

<p><span class="label label-danger">Very Important Note</span> An agent is always a participant of the default space of its inner space.</p>

<p><span class="label label-warning">Important Note</span> The unique identifier (usually a Unique Universal Identifier) of the inner context is equal to the unique identifier of its owning agent.</p>

<h3 id="14-universe-agent-and-universe-context">1.4. Universe Agent and Universe Context</h3>

<p>At the top level of the holarchy, we consider an omnipresent agent. It is named the <strong>Universe Agent</strong> (or <em>Root Agent</em>).
The runtime environment will be in charge of spawning the first agents in the system as members of the Universe Agent.</p>

<p>The inner context of the Universe Agent is called the Universe Context, or the Janus Context if you are using the
<a href="http://www.janusproject.io">Janus runtime environment</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2-open-architecture-of-an-agent">2. Open Architecture of an Agent</h2>

<p>The architecture of an agent is illustrated by the following figure.</p>

<p><img src="./agent.png" alt="Agent" /></p>

<h3 id="21-built-in-capacities">2.1. Built-in Capacities</h3>

<p>An agent has a set of built-in capacities considered essential to respect the
commonly accepted competencies of agents, such autonomy, reactivity, pro-activity
and social capacities.</p>

<p>The full set of Built-in Capacities will be presented in the corresponding
<a href="./BIC.html">Reference document</a>. Among these
built-in capacities, is the <code>Behaviors</code> capacity that enables 
agents to incorporate a collection of behaviors that will determine 
its global conduct.</p>

<h3 id="22-agent-behaviors">2.2. Agent Behaviors</h3>

<p>An agent has also a default behavior directly described within its definition.</p>

<p><strong>A Behavior maps a collection of perceptions represented by Events to a sequence of Actions.</strong>
The various behaviors of an agent communicate using an event-driven approach.</p>

<p><strong>An Event is the specification of some occurrence in a Space that may
potentially trigger effects by a listener</strong> (e.g., agent, behavior, etc.)</p>

<h2 id="3-defining-an-agent">3. Defining an Agent</h2>

<p>An agent is declared with the <code>agent</code> keyword. In the agent’s body block, we can declare Mental States
(in the form of attributes), Actions and Behaviors.</p>

<h3 id="31-defining-an-empty-agent">3.1. Defining an empty agent</h3>

<p>The following code illustrates the definition of an agent named <code>MyAgent</code>, and that is empty.
Basically, this agent does nothing, and does not react on events.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="32-agent-attributes">3.2. Agent Attributes</h3>

<p>The mental state of an agent is composed by the data in the knowledge of the agent.
Most of the time, the mental state is implemented as a collection of attributes in the agent.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="./GeneralSyntax.html">General Syntax Reference</a>,
the attributes may be modifiable (when declared with the <code>var</code> keyword), or unmodifiable (when
declared with the <code>val</code> keyword).</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	// Defining a modifiable element of the mental state
	var mentalStateElement1 : String
	// Defining an unmodifiable element of the mental state
	val mentalStateElement2 : boolean = true
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="33-agent-actions">3.3. Agent Actions</h3>

<p>It is allowed to define actions (methods) in the agent.
The syntax described is described in the <a href="./GeneralSyntax.html">General Syntax Reference</a>.</p>

<p>The example below illustrates the creation of two actions in the agent.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	uses Logging
	// Defining an action without parameter nor return type
	def myAction1 {
		info("Hello world")
	}
	// Defining an action with a variadic parameter and no return type
	def myAction2(param : int*) {
		info("params are " + param)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="34-extending-an-agent">3.4. Extending an Agent</h3>

<p>In some use cases, it is useful to specialize the definition
of an agent. This mechanism is supported by the inheritance
feature of SARL, which has the same semantic as the inheritance
mechanism as the Java object-oriented language.</p>

<p>The extended agent is specified just after the <code>extends</code> keyword.</p>

<p><span class="label label-danger">Very Important Note</span> An agent type can extend <strong>only one</strong> other agent type. This is close to the constraint on the extension of classes in the Java language.</p>

<p>In the following code, a first agent is defined with the name
<code>MyAgent</code> and an attribute named <code>attr</code>.
A second agent <code>MySubAgent</code> is defined as the extension of the first agent. It contains a function named
<code>action</code>, which is displaying the inherited attribute.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	protected var attr : String
}
agent MySubAgent extends MyAgent {
	uses Logging
	def action {
		info(attr)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="35-modifiers">3.5. Modifiers</h3>

<p>Modifiers are used to modify declarations of types and type members.
This section introduces the modifiers for the agent.
The modifiers are usually written before the keyword for defining the agent.</p>

<p>The complete description of the modifiers’ semantic is available in
<a href="./OOP.html#definition-of-all-the-supported-modifiers">this section</a>.</p>

<h4 id="agent-modifiers">Agent Modifiers</h4>

<p>An agent may be declared with one or more modifiers, which affect its runtime behavior:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access modifiers:
    <ul>
      <li><code>public</code>: the agent is accessible from any other type (default);</li>
      <li><code>package</code>: the agent is accessible from only the types in the same package.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>abstract</code>: the agent is abstract and cannot be instanced.</li>
  <li><code>final</code>: avoid to be derived.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">public agent Example1 {
}
package agent Example2 {
}
abstract agent Example3 {
}
final agent Example4 {
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="field-modifiers">Field Modifiers</h4>

<p>The modifiers for the fields in an agent are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access modifiers:
    <ul>
      <li><code>protected</code>: the field is accessible within the same package, and derived agents;</li>
      <li><code>package</code>: the field is accessible only within the same package of its agent;</li>
      <li><code>private</code>: the field is accessible only within its agent (default).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">protected var example1 : Object
package var example2 : Object
private var example3 : Object
</code></pre>

<h4 id="method-modifiers">Method Modifiers</h4>

<p>The modifiers for the methods in an agent are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access modifiers:
    <ul>
      <li><code>protected</code>: the method is accessible within the same package, and derived classes (default);</li>
      <li><code>package</code>: the method is accessible only within the same package as its class;</li>
      <li><code>private</code>: the method is accessible only within its class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>abstract</code>: the method has no implementation in the class.</li>
  <li><code>dispatch</code>: the method provides an implementation for the dispatch method mechanism.</li>
  <li><code>final</code>: the method cannot be overridden in derived classes.</li>
  <li><code>static</code>: the method is a class method, not an instance method.</li>
  <li><code>synchronized</code>: the method is synchronized on the class instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">// Protected access function
protected def example1 { }
// Package access function
package def example2 { }
// Private access function
private def example3 { }
// Abstract function
abstract def example4
// Not-overridable function
final def example5 { }
// Static function
static def example6 { }
// Synchronized function
synchronized def example7 { }
// Dispatch functions
dispatch def example8(p : Integer) { }
dispatch def example8(p : Float) { }
</code></pre>

<h4 id="restriction-on-the-nested-type-modifiers">Restriction on the Nested Type Modifiers</h4>

<p>All the <a href="./OOP.html">modifiers for the nested types</a> are allowed <strong>except</strong>
<code>public</code>.</p>

<h2 id="4-behaviors-of-an-agent">4. Behaviors of an Agent</h2>

<p>The behaviors of an agent correspond to the units that are executed by the agent for exhibiting its general behavior.</p>

<p>The execution of the behaviors are related to the life cycle of the agents. Every agent is following the steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initialization: the agent react on the <code>Initialize</code> event;</li>
  <li>Lifetime: the agent execute its behaviors. They may be:
    <ul>
      <li>reactive: the agent react when it is receiving events, or</li>
      <li>proactive: the agent executes by itself one of its behaviors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Destruction: the agent react on the <code>Destroy</code> event.</li>
</ul>

<p>The definition of the reactive behaviors is based on the event handling
mechanism of SARL. Events may be emitted in <a href="./Space.html">spaces</a>,
and received by the agents belonging to these spaces.
An agent may indicate that it is interesting for receiving an event by specifying
an event handler using the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">on EventName [Guard] {
	Statements
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>EventName</code> is the name of the events to wait for. <code>Guard</code> is the optional definition of a predicate
that may be true for executing the <code>Statements</code>. The statements are executed only if an event with the given name is
received, <strong>and</strong> if the guard is true.</p>

<p>In the guard and the statements, it is possible to use the instance of the received event: the occurrence.
This instance is represented by the <code>occurrence</code> keyword. It is an implicit
variable as the keywords <code>this</code> and <code>it</code>.</p>

<h3 id="41-initialization-handler">4.1. Initialization Handler</h3>

<h4 id="general-description">General Description</h4>

<p>When an agent is ready to be executed by the runtime environment, it receives the <code>Initialize</code> event.
This event is defined as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">class Initialize extends Event {
}
</code></pre>

<p>It contains the list of the parameters given to the spawning function (as specified in the 
<a href="./BIC.html">built-in capacities</a>).</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	uses Logging
	on Initialize {
		info("My spawner is " + occurrence.spawner)
		info(
			"My initialization parameters are: "
			+ occurrence.parameters )
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="guarded-initialization-handler">Guarded Initialization Handler</h4>

<p>Because <code>Initialize</code> is an event, the handler in the agent could use a guard. This feature enables
the developer to write different initialization blocks depending on the guards of the handlers.</p>

<p>In the following example, the first event handler is executed when the <code>Initialize</code> event has
no parameter. The second event handler is executed when the event has at least one parameter.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	uses Logging
	on Initialize [ occurrence.parameters.empty ] {
		info("Initialization without parameters")
	}
	on Initialize [ ! occurrence.parameters.empty ] {
		info("Initialization with parameters: "
			+ occurrence.parameters )
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="execution-of-the-initialization-handler">Execution of the Initialization Handler</h4>

<p>The <code>on Initialize</code> event handler in agents is a bit special, as it is the code run when an agent is born.
As such, its execution is more “synchronous” than other on-behavior rules. In particular:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Any event emitted within an <code>on Initialize</code>, will not be processed until that
<code>on Initialize</code> code finishes. So, your agent initialization should not depend
(and wait) on any fired event being processed, as they won’t!</li>
  <li>When spawning an agent in <code>on Initialize</code>, the spawn instructions will return only
after the agent has been created. However, creation of the agent (i.e., of the
corresponding object) does not include initialization of the agent via its 
<code>on Initialize</code> handler. Said so, the Java thread manager may process those
initialization processes of the new agent before continuing with the execution
of the spawning agent (and this seems to be the case in many Linux boxes
where the executor service of Java tends to have the same behavior during
all the runs). If you change computer, it may be different. In the following
example, the thread executor service of Java seems to give the priority to
the <code>on Initialize</code> of <code>Agent2</code> instead of continuing the run of the
spawn function.</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent Agent1 {
    uses Logging, Lifecycle
    var agent_name = "agent1"
    on Initialize {
        info(agent_name + " spawned")
        info(agent_name + " spawning Agent2")
        spawn(Agent2)
        info(agent_name + " end")
    }
}
agent Agent2 {
    uses Logging
    var agent_name = "agent2"
    on Initialize {
        info(agent_name + " spawned")
        info(agent_name + " sleeping")
        Thread::sleep(5000)
        info(agent_name + " woke up")
        info(agent_name + " end")
    }
    on Initialize {
        info(agent_name + " init2")
        info(agent_name + " init2 end")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output has been:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">Launching the agent: Agent1
agent1 spawned
agent1 spawning Agent2
agent2 spawned
agent2 init2
agent2 sleeping
agent2 init2 end
agent2 woke up
agent2 end
agent1 end
</code></pre>

<p>Here it appears as the <code>on Initialize</code> behaviors have been run all before
the execution resumes after the <code>spawn()</code> statement, but this is just one way
and one should not rely on that behavior being guaranteed: once the spawned
agent is created, the <code>spawn()</code> commands returns.</p>

<h4 id="multiple-initialization-handlers">Multiple Initialization Handlers</h4>

<p>It is allowed to declare multiple initialization handlers into a single agent type, as illustrated by:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent Agent3 {
	uses Logging
    on Initialize {
        info("1")
    }
    on Initialize {
        info("2")
    }
    on Initialize {
        info("3")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>According to the SARL operational semantic, the three event handlers for <code>Initialize</code> are run in parallel.
The initialization event handlers are not constructors (as defined in object-oriented programming paradigm),
they are reacting to the receiving of an <code>Initialize</code> occurrence.
Consequently, we could say that there is a single <code>Initialize</code> occurrence during the whole life of an agent;
But, it may have multiple handlers to react to the receiving of this event.</p>

<h4 id="initialization-handler-within-the-inheritance-hierarchy">Initialization Handler within the Inheritance Hierarchy</h4>

<p>The example in the previous section could be extended in order to illustrate how the initialization handlers
are run when the type of the agent (here <code>Agent4</code>) is declared within a inheritance hierarchy.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent Agent4 extends Agent3 {
	uses Logging
    on Initialize {
        info("4")
    }
    on Initialize {
        info("5")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>According to the SARL operational semantic, all the initialization handlers are run in parallel.
In the previous example, five event handlers will be run: three are defined into <code>Agent3</code>, and
two are defined into <code>Agent4</code>. This mechanism is generalized to all the events within an agent.</p>

<h3 id="42-destruction-handler">4.2. Destruction Handler</h3>

<h4 id="general-description-1">General Description</h4>

<p>The counterpart of <code>Initialize</code> is the event <code>Destroy</code>. This event is defined as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">class Destroy extends Event {
}
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	uses Logging
	on Destroy {
		info("Destroying the agent")
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="guarded-destruction-handler">Guarded Destruction Handler</h4>

<p>As for <code>Initialize</code>, the handlers of the <code>Destroy</code> event could be guarded.</p>

<p>In the following example, the first event handler is executed when the <code>Destroy</code>
is receivedand there is resource stored in the corresponding field. The second event handler
is executed when there is no resource.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	uses Logging
	var resource : Object
	on Destroy [ resource !== null ] {
		info("Destroying the agent when there is a resource")
	}
	on Destroy [ resource === null ] {
		info("Destroying the agent when there is no resource")
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="43-reactive-behaviors">4.3. Reactive Behaviors</h3>

<p>The reactive behavior of an agent is specified with a collection
of event handlers. The principle of a reactive behavior is to execute a part of the global
agent behavior when something has happening in the agent, or in its environment.</p>

<p>In the following example, the agent is reacting to the reception of the <code>SomethingChanged</code> event.</p>

<p>As for all the event handlers, it could be guarded by a predicate.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	uses Logging
	on SomethingChanged {
		info("Reactive behavior")
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="44-parallel-execution-of-the-reactive-behaviors">4.4. Parallel Execution of the Reactive Behaviors</h3>

<p>When an event is received and the guard of the corresponding handler is true, the event
handler is said to be triggered.</p>

<p>When multiple event handlers are triggered at the same time, they are all executed in parallel.
In the following example, the two handlers for the <code>SomethingChanged</code> event are executed in parallel.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	uses Logging
	on SomethingChanged {
		info("First reactive behavior")
	}
	on SomethingChanged {
		info("Second reactive behavior")
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="45-pro-active-behaviors">4.5. Pro-active Behaviors</h3>

<p>A proactive behavior is a part of the global behavior of an agent that the
agent is deciding to execute by itself.
The execution of a reactive behavior is initiated by a part of the code external to this
behavior. In opposite, the initiator of the execution of a proactive behavior is the
agent itself.</p>

<p>In SARL, a proactive behavior is a behavior that is scheduled by the agent. The scheduling
mechanism is provided by the <a href="./BIC.html"><code>Schedules</code> built-in capacity</a>.
In the following example, the agent execute its proactive behavior every second.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	uses Schedules, Logging
	on Initialize {
		every(1000) [
			info("Run a pro-active behavior")
		]
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="5-capacities-and-skills">5. Capacities and Skills</h2>

<p>An agent is an autonomous entity having a set of skills to realize the capacities it exhibits.
An agent has a set of built-in capacities considered essential to respect the commonly
accepted competencies of agents, such autonomy, reactivity, pro-activity and social capacities.</p>

<h3 id="51-defining-a-capacity-and-a-skill">5.1. Defining a Capacity and a Skill</h3>

<p>The definition of a capacity or a skill is out of the scope of this reference document. For details, please read
the <a href="./Capacity.html">Capacity Reference</a>, and the <a href="./Skill.html">Skill Reference</a>.</p>

<p>In the rest of this section, it is assumed that the following capacity and skill are defined:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">capacity Cap {
	def action
}

skill Ski implements Cap {
	uses Logging
	def action {
		info("Action")
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="52-giving-a-skill-to-an-agent">5.2. Giving a Skill to an Agent</h3>

<p>When an agent must use a capacity in one of its behaviors, it must own an implementation of this capacity: a skill.</p>

<p>For assigning a skill to an agent, the instance of the skill must be created. Then, it is associated with the
implemented capacity.
In the following example, the agent is creating the <code>Ski</code> skill. This instance is associated with
the corresponding capacity <code>Cap</code> with the function <code>setSkill(Skill, Class&lt;? extends Capacity&gt;*)</code>.</p>

<p>When the function <code>setSkill</code> is returning, the agent becomes able to use the skill.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	on Initialize {
		var theSkill = new Ski
		setSkill(theSkill)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>If some cases, you may want to set the skill if one was not set up before. The specific behavior
is supported by <code>setSkillIfAbsent(Skill, Class&lt;? extends Capacity&gt;*)</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	on Initialize {
		var theSkill = new Ski
		setSkillIfAbsent(theSkill)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="53-giving-a-built-in-skill-to-an-agent">5.3. Giving a Built-in Skill to an Agent</h3>

<p>Because the built-in capacities are supported by the runtime environment, the corresponding
skills are given to the agent. It means that there is no need for an agent to set a skill for
a built-in capacity.</p>

<p>However, in rare cases, it is possible to use the function <code>setSkill(Skill, Class&lt;? extends Capacity&gt;*)</code> for
changing the implementation of a built-in capacity.</p>

<h3 id="54-using-a-capacity-with-the-getters">5.4. Using a Capacity with the Getters</h3>

<p>After a skill is registered into the agent, it could be invoked.</p>

<p>For invoking a function implemented by a skill, the two following steps must be done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Retrieve the skill instance: the function <code>getSkill(Class&lt;? extends Capacity&gt;)</code> permits retrieving the skill associated to the given capacity;</li>
  <li>Invoke the capacity’s action on the retrieved skill.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="label label-info">Note</span> This method of invocation is not recommended by the SARL developers. You should prefer the use of the extension methods (see below).</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	on Initialize {
		var s = new Ski
		setSkill( s, Cap )
	}
	on SomeEvent {
		// Retreive the capacity implementation
		var s = getSkill(Cap)
		// Run the action of the skill
		s.action
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="55-using-a-built-in-capacity-with-the-getters">5.5. Using a Built-in Capacity with the Getters</h3>

<p>The built-in capacities are accessible in the same way as the other capacities, with the getters.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	on SomeEvent {
		// Retreive the capacity implementation
		var s = getSkill(Lifecycle)
		// Run the action of the skill
		s.killMe
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="56-using-a-capacity-with-the-extension-methods">5.6. Using a Capacity with the Extension Methods</h3>

<p>Invoking a capacity/skill with the getter method is not user-friendly. Since the
<a href="./GeneralSyntax.html">General Syntax Reference</a> describes the “extension method”
mechanism, it is possible to use it for invoking the capacities.</p>

<p>But, instead of using an <code>import</code> directive, the <code>uses</code> keyword is provided for importing the
capacities into the agent. In the following example, the <code>Cap</code> capacity is imported.</p>

<p>After a capacity was “imported”, it is possible to directly call the functions of the capacity
(according to the extension method syntax). In the following example, the action
with the name <code>action</code> is invoked. This action is defined in the <code>Cap</code> capacity.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	uses Cap
	on Initialize {
		var s = new Ski
		setSkill(s)
	}
	on SomeEvent {
		// Run the action of the skill
		action
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="57-using-a-built-in-capacity-with-the-extension-methods">5.7. Using a Built-in Capacity with the Extension Methods</h3>

<p>The built-in capacities are accessible in the same way as the other capacities, with the extension methods.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sarl">agent MyAgent {
	uses Lifecycle
	on SomeEvent {
		// Run the action of the skill
		killMe
	}
}
</code></pre>
